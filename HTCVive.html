  <p>HTC Vive: Everything you need to know about the SteamVR headset
Essential specs, price, games and more</p>
<hr>
<p>Originally unveiled at MWC 2015, the HTC Vive is the Taiwanese company's
  first stab at a virtual reality headset, and it's now ready for prime time.
Its original unveiling generated teeth-chattering levels of anticipation thanks
 to HTC's partnership with Valve, the US games giant behind the Steam digital
  distribution system and the Half-Life, Portal and DOTA game franchises.
The verdict is in: HTC Vive review
A hardware update at CES 2016 saw it re-dubbed the HTC Vive Pre, but at this
year's MWC HTC went back to the simple Vive moniker for the final consumer
edition. With it finally out in the wild, here's everything you need to know
about the headset, just in case you still have a few lingering questions.</p>
<hr>
<p>The consumer version of HTC Vive was released in April 2016.
We originally guessed the Vive would be pricier than the Oculus Rift, and boy
 were we right. The Oculus Rift consumer edition costs $500 with the final cost
  at $599 after shipping, while the Vive surpasses it with the final cost
   sitting at $799. However, you do get more hardware for your money.
   The HTC Vive bundle comes with two controllers, the Lighthouse base
   stations, some ear buds plus copies of the games Job Simulator: The 2050
   Archives and Fantastic Contraption. You'll need to provide a solid PC that
    will be able to run the experiences. Vive and PC bundles haven't been
    announced yet, unlike Oculus which has already got several deals
     for you to choose from.</p>
     <hr>
     <p>There's not too much change between the newest consumer Vive and the
       Pre in terms of specs and design. The updated design for the consumer
        release is much smaller and more comfortable to wear, with swappable
         foam inserts and what it's calling a nose 'gasket', as well as
         adjustable straps to get the fit right. And yes, you can use it with
          glasses.Must read: Oculus Rift v HTC ViveSome new features and
           refinements have been added, such as a better headstrap and updated
            motors, which HTC says should make the headset even more
            comfortable. The only real new feature is the Vive's ability to
            connect to iPhones and Android phones to deliver alerts and messages
             when you're in VR. It's called Vive Phone Services and, like the
             camera inclusion, seems to be there to help people spend time in
             VR games and movies while keeping in touch with the real world.</p>
             <hr>
             <p>The HTC Vive includes a display featuring two 1080 x 1200
               screens, one for each eye, and the pixel density is said to
               eliminate the screen door effect unless you really look for it.
This gives the Vive a total resolution of 2160 x 1200 pixels, and an aspect
ratio of 9:5 as opposed to other headsets' more standard 16:9. The result is a
taller image, but one which feels more natural and convincing â€“ you can look up
 with your eyeballs rather than by craning your neck. The screens run at 90Hz,
 which is on a par with Oculus Rift but lower than the 120Hz of Sony's Project
 Morpheus. Whether the difference will be noticeable remains to be seen, but we
  suspect that once you get into the realms above 90Hz gains are marginal.
There's also a front-facing camera, which means the real world can be overlaid
onto the virtual. In terms of gaming this opens up new possibilities for
augmented experiences, but critically it will also help users move around their
 real-world environments without removing the headset. As it stands the headset
 is tethered to a gaming computer with a bundle of data cables, but it's
 believed that the final version will reduce this to a single HDMI cable. This
 does raise the question of whether you'll be able to add USB peripherals to the
  consumer unit, though. There's also a 3.5mm jack on the side of the headset
  so you can add your own headphones.</p>
  <p>HTC has also announced an impressive roster of content partners for Vive,
    including HBO, Lionsgate, Google and Taiwan's National Palace Museum. No
    word on what this content will involve, but it's arguable that TV and
    film-style content is more important than games when it comes to getting
    the general public into virtual reality.</p>
