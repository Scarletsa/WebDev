  <p>Here are 4 things you should know about the new Oculus Rift.

First up, Oculus is partnering with Microsoft. That means Rifts
will work natively with Windows 10, and be able to stream Xbox One
 games, and will ship with an Xbox One controller. It's a good
 move for Oculus as far as content and audience go. But also,
 we've learned that Microsoft is also partnering with Valve,
 and of course, they've got their AR headset Hololens. So,
 maybe it's a new age for Microsoft.</p><hr>
 <p>
   Second, speaking of that Xbox One controller, inputs were a
   big question going into the event — what Oculus saved for the
   end was the introduction of Oculus Touch, which is a pair of
   tracked hand controllers that include haptics. The prototypes
   are called Half Moon, which is precious, and they do all kinds
   of things like deliver low-latency hand presence, and gesture
   and finger pose recognition. That seemed to appease the folks
    who were struck with a certain ennui at the thought of using
    a plane old Xbox One controller. </p><hr>

    <p>Third, Oculus is putting 10 million dollars toward indie game
      development. That sounds like a lot of money, and it makes
      sense that Oculus would want to help make sure that there's
       lots of content available on the Rift, but one analyst we
       talked to said that in the game development space,
       10 million really isn't that much.</p> <hr>

       <p>And fourth, the new Rift is supposed to be relatively
         easy to use — they say you can put it on like a baseball
         cap. They say, it'll work right out of the box. You can even
          keep your glasses on to use it. It'll be lightweight,
          won't pull on your face, and convection, according to
          founder Palmer Luckey, will keep the lenses from fogging
          up. Obviously, it's not available yet so we haven't tried
          it — but considering what a pain the most recent developer
          kits could be — man. You sure hope it's plug and play.</p>
