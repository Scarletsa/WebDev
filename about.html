  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>
    This isn't a real e-commerce website. This website was created for a class
    called CSCI 2005-90 in the Fall of 16'. The instructor of the class is Professor
    Zak Baani. The site was created by: Chris Payne, Michael Albrecht, and
    Taylor Jordan. The aim of the project was to build a website from scracth and
    to have atleast five pages with basic: wishlist, shopping cart, account, and
    checkout functionality. We chose VR headsets because of their growing popularity
    and relevance in the current culture.
