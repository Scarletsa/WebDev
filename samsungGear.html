  <p>Samsung has been working with the biggest name in virtual reality for over
     two years to bring a little bit of the virtual world to your smartphone,
     and with the Samsung Gear VR that experience is finally consumer-ready.
     Anyone who has been following the development of this and related VR
     accessories for smartphones knows there are a lot of exciting things
     happening right now in this space, and that can make choosing which one to
      spend money on a little complicated. To help with this, we've assembled a
       quick list of things you need to know about the Samsung Gear VR before
        you either consider or dismiss its existence as a physical accessory
         to transport you to the virtual world.</p>
         <hr>
         <p>You will frequently hear folks who have never used a Gear VR, or
           those who have only used it for a moment or two, call the Samsung
           Gear VR an expensive version of Google Cardboard. While it's true
           there are some similarities (namely the part where you put your
           phone in the little box and look through the lenses on the other
           side to see pretty pictures and video) there's quite a bit of actual
            hardware difference. For starters, there's a microUSB dock in the
            Gear VR mount that offers some hardware assistance to the Gear VR
            when you're looking through those lenses. Additional sensors make
            head tracking noticeably smoother, which in turn decreases that
            motion-based disorientation so many feel when trying out
            smartphone-based VR for the first time. You'll also find a touchpad
             on the side of the Gear VR that offers a significantly greater
             number of control options for navigating not only the
             Oculus-provided interface, but also a significant number of the
             included apps. Games like CCP's Gunjack, for example, requires
             more than a single button interface and that is going to make
             porting it to Cardboard more than a little difficult. There's
             also a back button and a fine focus wheel to dial things in just
             right. Basically, anyone who tells you the Gear VR is an expensive
              Google Cardboard is wrong and should feel bad.</p>
              <hr>
              <p>One of the big things Samsung and Oculus have going for them
                thanks to the more than two years of public development on this
                 platform is the list of content available at launch. The Gear
                 VR has a huge selection of video apps, including Netflix, for
                 users to consume and share. You can get VR video just about
                 everywhere nowadays though, what makes the Gear VR really stand
                  out is the impressive selection of games available already.
Oculus tapped the creator of the highly anticipated Rift game EVE: Valkyrie for
 Gunjack on the Gear VR, which currently sits atop a list including cryptic
  puzzle game Land's End by UsTwo games, the folks behind Monument Valley.
  This same list includes an Adventure Time hack and slash, a seriously dark
  zombie shooter, several racing games, and an amazing VR arcade experience
  featuring hits like Galaga and several Sonic the Hedgehog titles.You aren't
  likely to run out of things to do in the Oculus Store anytime soon, and there
  are many more games headed to the Gear VR next year</p>
